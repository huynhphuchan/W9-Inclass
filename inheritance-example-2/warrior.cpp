 * Warrior Constructor

 * this default values by sending new values to this constructor.

 * @param birthday birthday of the warrior
 * @param attackDamage the maximum attack damage this warrior can inflict
 * @param shield the initial shield value, this will protect the hit points until it runs out
 * @param hitPoints the life of the warrior, once it becomes zero the warrior is dead

 * Attack of the Warrior
 * This method returns the attack value of the warrior. The value is calculated by the throw
 * of a six face die. The value of the attack is equal to the number of the die divided by 6
 * multiplied by the attack damage set of the warrior. The minimum attack of a warrior is 1/6

 * Defense of a Warrior
 * This method represents the warrior receiving damage. The parameter represents how
 * much attack damage is being received. The attack damage will first affect the shield
 * once the warrior runs out of shield, it will start affecting the hit points. Once the
 * warrior runs out of hit points the warrior dies.
